Subject:
A subject is nothing but an Observable but a special one which allows values to be multicasted to many Observers.
I would normally prefer BehaviorSubject instead of Subject.

BehaviorSubject:
It is a variant of Subject that requires an initial value and emits its current value whenever it is subscribed to.
It is sometimes important to coding preference to not have a null value, as it is initialised with a value.
For Example we want to show the total items added to your cart in a e-comerce website. You can use behaviorSubject with an initialised value of 0. If not we have do a null check in the Cart component.
ReplaySubject:  it can cache up to a specified number of emissions. Any subscribers will get all the cached values upon subscription. I have never come across a use case that uses this. May be when we try to record a users last seen products in a e-comerce website we can use it.
