1). I have used jest with Enzyme
    Jest acts as a test runner, assertion library, and mocking library.
    Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes 
       it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Componentsâ€™ output.

2). I have been using Enzyme for few years. I didn't see any pitfalls associated with this technology. 
    it have good support as well

    expect(wrapper.props().includedProp).to.equal('Success!');
